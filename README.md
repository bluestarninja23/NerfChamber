## Teams That Made It
In Valorant Franchising for North America, there were only 5 teams that made it into the tier 1 scene.
These teams consist of 100 Thieves, Sentinels, Evil Geniuses, Cloud 9, and NRG.

## Teams That were Left Out
Some of the notable teams that did not make it are OPTIC, and XSET, 2 notable teams that both finished within the top 4 in Valorant Champions 2022. 
Valorant Champions consisted of the best teams from all around the world that competed against each other on an international stage. 
This left many people in shock to see that the best 2 teams currently in NA did not make it into franchising.

### What Now?
Professional Valorant players from former tier 1 teams are leaving their teams and becoming a free agent, in hope that a team in Franchising will pick them up. 
Teams such as Optic, and XSET are breaking up their teams and heading in different directions, following the news of not making it into Franchising. 
Some teams however, will still stay together as a team and play in Tier 2 tounaments, and work their way up to the top from there.

### Controversy with Riot Games
Many people are wondering why the best teams in the world did not make Franchising this year? 
It turns out that Riot Games chose the teams based on their relationship with the organization, rather than their skill level in the Valorant scene. 
Teams that people thought would make it, such as TSM, FaZe, and Optic did not get in due to their negative relationship and controversy from years prior with Riot Games.
With XSet, their players were suppose to be bought out by G2, another organziation, but did not make it and was switched out with another team at the last second.
The reason for this is that the owner of G2 was friends with Andrew Tate, or the "Top G" and Riot Games did not want to partner with them.
Following the Andrew Tate conbtroversy, Riot Games did not want to partner with G2, with that set up mindset and bad influence that would be upon them.

#### Notable Free Agents
One of the names that has every organization's attention is Optic Yay, who is one of the best players in the world. 
He was being offered $1 million contracts from teams from the EMEA region, but even turned this offer down, probably wanting to stay in the NA region. 
Currently, he is being rumored to join Cloud 9 that would ultimately make C9 instantly one of the favorites. 
For XSET Cryo, another player who is one of the best in the NA region, joined 100 Thieves, meaning 100T Will is either going to be released or moved to the bench.
NRG is also rumored to be getting 3 of the former optic players, consisting of Crashies, FNS, and Victor, as well as their coach. 
There are many players in the future that will be joining teams, along with organizations dropping the current players with their team. 
Nobody is safe on every team, making the future of Valorant unpredictable with all the new roster changes.
